# Blockchain Voter Registration System

## Overview

This project aims to create a secure and efficient voter registration system leveraging blockchain technology. By addressing the weaknesses of the current Michigan voter registration system, we aim to enhance data privacy, integrity, and accessibility.

## Current System Problems

- **Weak check-in requirements** on election day, increasing the risk of fraud.
- **Vulnerability to data leaks and breaches** due to reliance on a central server.

## Benefits of Blockchain

- **Completely private data**: Ensures voter information remains confidential.
- **Enhanced data integrity**: Difficult to modify large amounts of data from a single breach, making it a more secure option.

## Project Goals

1. **Design and Implementation**: Decide on the design and implementation of the blockchain technology.
2. **Hardware Requirements**: Compile a list of necessary hardware for the project.
3. **Frontend Development**:
   - Create a basic registration website.
   - Develop a check-in interface for election day.
4. **Backend Development**: Build a functional backend using React.js, including:
   - REST APIs for frontend functionalities.
   - A database of eligible voters using local PostgreSQL.
   - Voter authentication via blockchain queries.
5. **Security Review**: Conduct a comprehensive review of the system's security measures.
6. **Database Model Evaluation**: Analyze bottom-up, top-down, and hybrid database models.
7. **Voter Details Management**: Implement functionality to modify voter details with notifications.
8. **Blockchain Integration**: Enable blockchain queries for voter check-ins.
